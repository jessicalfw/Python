Abstract 

The current study investigates the financial sustainability of renewable energy sources amidst the transition to a greener energy landscape, focusing on the challenges posed by the cannibalization effect. 

Leveraging data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) spanning June 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, we provide empirical evidence of the cannibalization effect in renewable production, revealing a significant negative correlation between renewable outputs and their market value, both on hourly and daily levels using linear regression model. 

Additionally, we explore the potential role of utility-scale battery storage as a solution to mitigate this effect. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our regression analysis indicates that batteries act as substitutes rather than complements to renewable energy, potentially exacerbating the financial challenges faced by renewables. 

We attribute this competitive relationship to batteries' operational characteristics, designed to capitalize on price differentials throughout the day to sustain their own financial viability. To assess battery storage’s potential as a complementary product, we construct a hypothetical scenario where battery output is delayed by four hours, and discovered a positive correlation between renewable and battery outputs, revenue, and profit in this scenario. 

Overall, our study contributes to understanding the dynamics between renewable energy, battery storage, and market forces, providing insights for policymakers regarding the synergy potential between battery and renewables.
